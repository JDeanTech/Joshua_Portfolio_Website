        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          From a young age, I have been passionate about working with computers,
          which solidified my decision to pursue a career in this field. My
          first couple years of working in the field I worked in IT Support and
          entry level Server Administration where I used a lot of Powershell
          coding to automate and make my job easier. I currently work as a
          DevSecOps Engineer where I maintain the CI/CD pipeline, oversee
          application technical debt management, and ensure the application
          lifecycle operates efficiently.

          field.
