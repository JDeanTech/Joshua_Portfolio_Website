    <p>
        I have always tinkered with computers since I was little, so I knew this field was what I wanted to be in.
        My first couple years of IT have been IT Support and Server Admin where I used a lot of Powershell coding to automate and make my job easier.
        I currently oversee from a Engineer standpoint the Life Cycle of the Air Force Web based software that is in development and in production at most (if not all) Air Force bases throughout the world.
