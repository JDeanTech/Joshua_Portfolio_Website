    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
            From a young age, I have been passionate about working with computers, which solidified my decision to pursue a career in this field.
            My first couple years of working in the field I worked in IT Support and entry level Server Administration where I used a lot of Powershell coding to automate and make my job easier.
            I currently work as a DevSecOps Engineer where I maintain the CI/CD pipeline, oversee application technical debt management, and ensure the application lifecycle operates efficiently.
